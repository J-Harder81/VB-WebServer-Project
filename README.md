# VirtualBox WebServer LAMP Stack Project  
## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a Linux-based web server using a full **LAMP Stack** (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) running inside **VirtualBox**. The purpose of the project is to illustrate core Operating System Architecture concepts such as virtualization, process and service management, file systems, networking, and resource allocation in a real-world server environment.  

The hosted web application explains each layer of the LAMP stack and provides tutorials on how to install and configure VirtualBox, Ubuntu Server, Apache, MySQL, and PHP using content that is stored in a MySQL database and dynamically retireved using PHP.
